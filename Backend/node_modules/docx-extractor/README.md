Node.js: docx-extractor
=================

This module allows you to extract comments in 'docx' files and other data stored such as author name, hyperlinks, modification times, etc.


Why?
----

It was a requirement of a job I was working on and I could not find any modules to do this. It was a pain to have to try and create it at the time of the job so I figured I would just make a module incase anyone else ever needed it.

Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions. It can always be improved so I accept any and all feedback.




Installation
------------

npm install --save docx-extractor



Usage
-----

docx-extractor is a module that will let you extract the comments embedded into the xml of 'docx' files as well as other data.

Every method uses the same format as below. Just replace "someMethod" below with the name of the method you want to use.

Example:

```js
var dxe = require('docx-extractor');

dxe.someMethod('myfile.docx', function(data){
    console.log(data)
});
```
